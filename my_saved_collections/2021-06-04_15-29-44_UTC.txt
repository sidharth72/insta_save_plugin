• Leeds, Headingley Hill Congregational Chapel •

Exterior aisle window details of the former Headingley Hill Congregational Chapel in Leeds. The church is closed and work is being carried out to put the building back in use, although as what I can’t say I know personally. The church was designed by Cuthbert Brodrick and completed in 1866. It was the only church to have been designed by Brodrick, who is well known for Leeds Town Hall and the Corn Exchange.
